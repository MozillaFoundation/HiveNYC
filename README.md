#Welcome!

Between November 2015 and June 2016, the Hive NYC Community Coordinator, in collaboration with the Network Manager, spearheaded a set of projects designed to help us streamline communications and track member engagement.
 
We have documented these projects for the benfit of current and future Hive NYC staff and in the spirit of [Working Open](), which is core to the mission of [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/about/).
