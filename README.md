#Welcome!

Between November 2015 and June 2016, the Hive NYC Community Coordinator, in collaboration with the Network Manager, spearheaded a set of projects designed to streamline communications and help us track member information and engagement.
 
We have documented these projects for the benfit of current and future Hive NYC staff and in the spirit of [Working Open](), which is core to the mission of [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/about/).

In this wiki, you will find documentation about these projects.

1. Member Directory
2. Community Map
3. Email templates
4. Network Analytics
5. 'Round-up Robot'
