#Welcome!

Between November 2015 and June 2016, the Hive NYC Community Coordinator spearheaded five projects in collaboration with the Hive NYC Network Manager. All five projects aligned to two goals.

1. Streamline communications.
2. Create systems to track member information and engagement.
 
We have documented these projects for the benfit of current and future Hive NYC staff and in the spirit of [Working Open](), which is core to the mission of [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/about/).

Projects documented in this wiki include:

1. Member Directory
2. Community Map
3. Email templates
4. Network Analytics
5. 'Round-up Robot'
