#Welcome!

Between November 2015 and June 2016, the Hive NYC Community Coordinator spearheaded a series of projects in collaboration with the Hive NYC Network Manager, which centered around streamlining communications procedures and building systems to track and manage member engagement.

We have documented these projects for the benfit of current and future Hive NYC staff and in an effort to [Work Open](), which is a core principal of Mozilla Foundation.

Projects documented in this wiki include:

1. Member Directory
2. Community Map
3. Email templates
4. Network Analytics
5. 'Round-up robot' Email Bot

To learn about these projects, please refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/HiveNYC/wiki) of this repository).
